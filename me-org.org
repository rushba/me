The following displays the contents of code blocks in Org-mode files
using the major-mode of the code.  It also changes the behavior of
=TAB= to as if it were used in the appropriate major mode.  This means
that reading and editing code form inside of your Org-mode files is
much more like reading and editing of code using its major mode.
